### Hi there 👋 I'm Ankit Chaudhary,

A Data engineer passionate about Data Science :bar_chart:. I like automating, building scalable pipelines, and improving and optimizing systems. I am a Strong Advocate for 📜 open source, :cloud: Cloud computing, 🚀 DevOps, :new: Innovation and Automation :robot: 

- 🌱 I’m currently pursuing **Masters in Advanced Computer Science at Bangor University, UK**
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I **strongly** I am a firm believer in the *Chaos theory*, which states that even in unpredictable environments with seemingly random oddities and irregularities, there exists a predictable and sensible pattern that is not initially visible.
- :bulb: I'm interested in all things data: **Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, Deep and Reinforcement Learning, Data Science and Visualizations**
- 💬 Talk to me about Bike riding 🏇, Movies 🎥, PubG 🎮, Photography 📸
